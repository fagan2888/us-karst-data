Karst is a type of landscape, characterized by cave and cavern development, sinkholes, disappearing streams, and other features caused by the solution of carbonate bedrock. Karst also includes areas characterized by erosional caves, lava tubes, and other features formed in non-carbonate rock. Worldwide, 25 percent of the planet's population lives on karst or obtains water from karst aquifers.

In the United States, karst makes up over a fifth of the total landscape and karst aquifers provide 40 percent of the nation's water supply. Karst areas also provide habitats for unique creatures and plants, many of which are extremely rare. Major karst areas occur in more than 20 states, and there are numerous smaller karst areas across the continent. Explore the map to learn more about karst areas found in the United States.

# Karst Applied Research Studies  
Graphic: Map shows relatively dry and humid areas, as well as the extent of potentially karstic rock types in the contiguous United States.
The Karst Applied Research Studies through Geologic Mapping (KARST) project is funded primarily by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program. Karst landscapes are typically underlain by relatively soluble rocks, such as limestone, which contain solution features like caves, sinkholes and springs. KARST scientists currently perform research and geologic mapping in areas of the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and West Virginia. The project anticipates expanding into new study areas in Pennsylvania in 2015. KARST is also working on updates and improvements to the new national KARST map and database. We invite public feedback and comments regarding our work. contact: Dave Weary
