These maps show areas underlain by soluble rocks and also by volcanic rocks, sedimentary deposits, and permafrost that have potential for karst or pseudokarst development. All 50 States contain rocks with potential for karst development, and about 18 percent of their area is underlain by soluble rocks having karst or the potential for development of karst features. The areas of soluble rocks shown are based primarily on selection from State geologic maps of rock units containing significant amounts of carbonate or evaporite minerals. Areas underlain by soluble rocks are further classified by general climate setting, degree of induration, and degree of exposure. Areas having potential for volcanic pseudokarst are those underlain chiefly by basaltic-flow rocks no older than Miocene in age. Areas with potential for pseudokarst features in sedimentary rocks are in relatively unconsolidated rocks from which pseudokarst features, such as piping caves, have been reported. Areas having potential for development of thermokarst features, mapped exclusively in Alaska, contain permafrost in relatively thick surficial deposits containing ground ice. This report includes a GIS database with links from the map unit polygons to online geologic unit descriptions.</abstract><purpose>These data were compiled to delineate the distribution of karst and potential karst and pseudokarst areas of the United States. The data in this report are preliminary, and there is an expectation of upgrade in content, quality, and resolution in future versions. The data are released as an Open-File Report to expedite transfer of this information to various users across the United States. These data were compiled from multiple sources at various spatial resolutions. They are intended for use as guidance in determining the distribution of areas of potential karst at national, State, and regional scales. Because of differences in projection and scale of the various geologic datasets, spatial errors and location inconsistencies are particularly noticeable along some State boundaries, particularly coastlines and riparian borders. These data should not be used to define boundaries for site-specific applications or for legal purposes.</purpose><supplinf>Suggested citation:

Graphical map depictions are intended to be used within the map scale limits applicable to the source GIS data of various original resolution and scales. The resolution of the geologic data ranges from 1:24,000 to 1:500,000. The graphics are designed for display at 1:6,000,000 scale for the contiguous United States and Alaska, and 1:3,000,000 scale for Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They will print at these scales at 100 percent resolution. The geographic data for all of these maps is in Albers projection using the North American Horizontal Datum of 1983. Although software enables the user to view data at various scales, the user is cautioned to refer to the source documentation for the appropriate map scale limitations.</useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey, NORTHEAST REGION</cntorg><cntper>David J Weary</cntper></cntorgp><cntpos>Research Geologist</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><address>Mail Stop 926A, 12201 Sunrise Valley Dr</address><city>Reston</city><state>VA</state><postal>20192-0002</postal><country>US</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>703-648-6897</cntvoice><cntfax>703-648-6953</cntfax><cntemail>dweary@usgs.gov</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac><datacred>The data for this map were compiled and edited by David J. Weary and Daniel H. Doctor of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Most of the spatial data compiled in this project originated as lithologic map units on geologic maps produced by various State geological surveys. Versions of the original source maps are available for purchase or download from the respective State geological surveys. Much of the digital map data for this project was compiled from a series of integrated geologic map databases for the United States produced by the USGS Mineral Resources Program (see https://mrdata.usgs.gov/geology/state/, accessed May 16, 2014). Use of the USGS digital geologic data provided a consistent data structure within which a derivative database of areas with potential for karst could be constructed. In some areas, other miscellaneous datasets and publications were referenced to facilitate accurate map compilation. These references are cited in the COMMENTS field of the feature data.</datacred><native>Environment as of Metadata Creation: Microsoft Windows 7 Version 6.1 (Build 7601) Service Pack 1; ESRI ArcCatalog 10.0 (Build 2414) Service Pack 1 (Build 2800)</native></idinfo><dataqual><attracc><attraccr>No formal attribute accuracy tests were conducted.</attraccr></attracc><logic>No formal logical accuracy tests were conducted.</logic><complete>Dataset is considered complete for the information presented, as described in the abstract.
